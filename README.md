# AnalogClock
Our analog clock project will create a clock that displays the current time based on the user's browser. Using JavaScript, we will convert the current time into degrees to reflect the current time on the clock face. We will update the clock hands' positions dynamically using JavaScript, creating a real-time effect. CSS will style the clock face, hands, and logo for a sleek and professional appearance. This project will enhance our JavaScript skills by manipulating the DOM and working with the Date object and CSS skills for styling elements.
